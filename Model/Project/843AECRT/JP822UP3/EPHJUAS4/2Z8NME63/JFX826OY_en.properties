NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.qualified-rename-values=The qualified form for rename events controls whether the new-name portion of rename events coming from the Identity Vault are presented to the Subscriber channel with type qualifier(s) (e.g. CN\=). A "true" setting means the names are presented in qualified form.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.driver.class.jdbc=Third-party JDBC driver class name\:
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.retry-interval=The subscriber channel retry interval controls how frequently the DirXML Engine will retry the processing of a cached transaction after the application shim's Subscriber object returns a retry status.

NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.key-gen-timing.beforerowinsertiondefault=before row insertion (default)
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.check-update-count=Select whether the Subscriber channel checks to see if rows are updated after insert, update, or delete statements are exectued against the tables.  This parameter is desirable in cases where you want to ensure the statements are actually making changes in the database.  It is undesirable in the event that statements are intercepted by triggers that fire before a statement is executed because they might redefine or ignore the statement.  This parameter has no effect on views.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.idmresource.NTQJDBCPSGBSRemoteLoaderPrompts.gcv.use-remote-loader=Connect To Remote Loader\:

NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.use-manual-transactions=Select whether this driver uses transactions.  Are transactions supported by the target database or table implementation you are using?
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.jdbc.DataFlow.bi-directional=bi-directional
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.jdbc.SyncModel.Indirect=Indirect
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.key-gen-method=Select how the primary key values are being generated or retrieved.  This setting is global for all tables or views.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.drv.name=Driver Name\:
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.sync-filter=On start-up, the driver caches database metadata on a limited number of tables or views to facilitate data synchronization.  You can cache no table or view metadata (exclude all tables or views), cache metadata on all tables or views owned by a single database user (include by schema membership) or cache metadata on an explicit list of table or view names (include by table or view name).  If no table or view metadata is cached, the driver acts as a pass-through agent for embedded SQL.  In this state, standard XDS events (add, modify, delete) are ignored.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.key-gen-method.auto-generated/identitycolumn=auto-generated/identity column
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.check-update-count=Check update counts?

NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.jdbc.DataFlow.IdentityManagertodatabasesubscribe=Identity Manager to database (subscribe)
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.use-manual-transactions.no=no
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.jdbc.DataFlow.databasetoIdentityManagerpublish=database to Identity Manager (publish)
NOVLJDBCPGBS.idmresource.NTQJDBCPSGBSDriverNamePrompt.gcv.dscr.name=Enter the driver name.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.idmresource.NTQJDBCPSGBSRemoteLoaderPrompts.gcv.dscr.rl-password=The Remote Loader password is used to control access to the Remote Loader instance.  It must be the same password that is specified as the Remote Loader password on the Identity Manager Remote Loader.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.use-pending-association=Write pending associations
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.qualified-dn-values=The qualified specification for DN-syntax attribute values controls whether values for DN-syntax attribute values are presented in unqualified slash form or qualified slash form. A "true" setting means the values are presented in qualified form.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.use-manual-transactions=Use manual transactions?
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.use-manual-transactions.dynamicdefault=dynamic default
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.xslt-bc-mode=Use non-compliant backwards-compatible mode for XSLT
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.set-creators-name=This control is used by the DirXML Engine to determine if the creatorsName attribute should be set to the DN of this driver on all objects created in the Identity Vault by this driver.\n \n Setting the creatorsName attribute allows for easily identifying objects created by this driver, but also carries a performance penalty. If not set, the creatorsName attribute will default to the DN of the NCP Server object that is hosting the driver.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.add-default-values-on-view-insert.no=no
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.supports-schemas-in-metadata-retrieval.dynamicdefault=dynamic default
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.jdbc.SyncModel=Select a Direct or Indirect synchronization model.  Direct synchronization uses views to synchronize directly to existing tables of arbitrary structure.  Indirect synchronization synchronizes to intermediate staging tables with a particular structure.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.max-migrate-app-count=Maximum application objects to migrate at once.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.add-default-values-on-view-insert=Add default values on view insert?
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.jdbc.DataFlow=Select the data flow that you desire. Bi-directional means that both the database and Identity Manager are authoritative sources of the data synchronized between them.  Database to Identity Manager means that the database is the authoritative source.  Identity Manager to database means that Identity Manager is the authoritative source.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.max-migrate-app-count=This control is used to limit the number of application objects that the DirXML Engine will request from an application during a single query that is performed as part of a "migrate objects from application" operation. \n \n If "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError" errors are encountered during a migrate from application operation then this number should be set lower than the default. \n \n Note that this control does not limit the number of application objects that can be migrated; it merely limits the "batch size".
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.pwd-sync-status=This control determines whether the DirXML Engine will report the status of subscriber channel password change events. \n \n Reporting the status of subscriber channel password change events allows applications such as the Identity Manager User Application to monitor the synchronization progress of a password change that should be synchronized to the connected application.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.max-replication-wait=The maximum eDirectory replication wait time controls the maximum time that the DirXML Engine will wait for a particular change to replicate between the local replica and a remote replica. This only affects operations where the DirXML Engine is required to contact a remote eDirectory server in the same tree to perform an operation and may need to wait until some change has replicated to or from the remote server before the operation can be completed (e.g. object moves when the DirXML server does not hold the master replica of the moved object ;file system rights operations for Users created from a template.)
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.pwd-sync-status=Enable password synchronization status reporting
NOVLJDBCPGBS.idmresource.NTQJDBCPSGBSRemoteLoaderPrompts.gcv.rl-hostname=Host Name\:
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.key-gen-timing=Select when the primary key values are retrieved.  Select whether the key values are retrieved before or after the row insertion.  This setting is global for all tables or views.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.publisher.disable=Select whether you want to ignore events flowing to Identity Manager from the database.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.supports-schemas-in-metadata-retrieval.yes=yes
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.use-password-event-values=Use password event values
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.force-username-case=Force username case\:
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.use-password-event-values=This control determines the source of the value reported for the nspmDistributionPassword attribute for subscriber channel add and modify events.\n \n Setting the control to false means that the current value of nspmDistributionPassword is obtained and reported as the value of the attribute event. This means that only the current password value is available. This is the default behavior.\n \n Setting the control to true means that the value recorded with the eDirectory event will be decrypted and reported as the value of the attribute event. This means that both the old password value (if it exists) and the replacement password value at the time of the event are available. This is useful for synchronizing passwords to certain applications that require the old password to enable setting a new password.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.check-update-count.yesdefault=yes (default)
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.add-default-values-on-view-insert.yes=yes
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.check-update-count.no=no
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.driver.class.jdbc=Specify the class name of your third-party JDBC driver.  Verify that the jar or zip file containing this class is version compatible with the target database.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dirxml.engine.set-creators-name=Set creatorsName on objects created in Identity Vault.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.force-username-case.touppercase=to upper case
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.force-username-case.don'tforcedefault=don't force (default)
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.key-gen-method.subscriber-generated=subscriber-generated
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.force-username-case.tolowercase=to lower case
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.force-username-case=Select the case of the authentication username.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.jdbc.SyncModel.Direct=Direct
NOVLJDBCPGBS.idmresource.NTQJDBCPSGBSRemoteLoaderPrompts.gcv.choice.use-remote-loader.no=no
NOVLJDBCPGBS.idmresource.NTQJDBCPSGBSRemoteLoaderPrompts.gcv.choice.use-remote-loader.yes=yes
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.add-default-values-on-view-insert=Add default values on view insert?
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.publisher.disable.nodefault=no (default)
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.sync-filter=Synchronization filter\:
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.dscr.subscriber.disable=Select whether you want to ignore events flowing from Identity Manager to the database.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.idmresource.NTQJDBCPSGBSRemoteLoaderPrompts.gcv.dscr.driver-password=The Driver Object Password is used by the Remote Loader to authenticate itself to the Identity Manager server.  It must be the same password that is specified as the Driver Object Password on the Identity Manager Remote Loader.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.subscriber.disable.nodefault=no (default)
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.force-username-case.tomixedcase=to mixed case
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.xslt-bc-mode=This control sets the XSLT processor used by the DirXML Engine to a backwards-compatible mode. The backwards-compatible mode causes the XSLT processor to use one or more behaviors that are not XPath 1.0 and/or XSLT 1.0 standards-compliant. This is done in the interest of backwards-compatiblity with existing DirXML stylesheets that depend on the non-standard behavior(s). \n \n In particular\: \n \n The behavior of the XPath "\!\=" operator when one operand is a node-set and the other operand is other than a node-set is incorrect in DirXML releases up to and including DirXML 2.0 (Novell Identity Manager 2.0). This behavior has been corrected; however, the corrected behavior is disabled by default through this control in favor of backwards-compatibility with existing DirXML stylesheets.
pkg.description=The PostgreSQL Base package contains database configuration details such as database version, JDBC connection string, shim authentication information and remote loader details.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.idmresource.NTQJDBCPSGBSRemoteLoaderPrompts.gcv.dscr.rl-port=Enter the Port Number where the Remote Loader Service has been installed and is running for this driver. The Default Port is 8090.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.idmresource.NTQJDBCPSGBSRemoteLoaderPrompts.gcv.dscr.rl-hostname=Enter the Host Name or IP Address where the Remote Loader Service has been installed and is running for this driver. [Host Name or IP Address; \#\#\#.\#\#\#.\#\#\#.\#\#\#]
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.ecv.dscr.dirxml.engine.use-pending-association=This control determines whether the DirXML Engine will write a pending association on an object during subscriber channel processing.\n \n Writing a pending association confers little or no benefit but does incur a performance penalty. Nevertheless, the option exists to turn it on for backward compatibility.
NOVLJDBCPGBS.initial.settings.gcv.choice.sync-filter.includebytable/viewname=include by table/view name
NOVLJDBCPGBS.idmresource.NTQJDBCPSGBSRemoteLoaderPrompts.gcv.rl-password=Remote Password\:
